<p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It consists of a series of elements, which are represented by tags. These tags define different parts of the web page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.</p>

<p>HTML is widely used in web development and is the foundation of most websites. HTML files are typically saved with a <code>.html</code> or <code>.htm</code> file extension and can be opened in web browsers to display the content. Web developers use HTML to structure the content of a web page, while CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the appearance, and JavaScript is used to add interactivity.</p>

<p>HTML is a standard maintained by the <a href ="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a> and is constantly evolving to meet the needs of modern web development. The latest version of HTML is HTML5, which introduced new features and capabilities to enhance the user experience on the web.</p>
